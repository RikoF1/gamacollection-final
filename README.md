Gamacollection is a mobile-first application that was built with the objective of letting game collector's have their collection on their hand and know it's value at the time of checking, also, let's the user know how much they have paid for each of the items on the list.

The watchlist helps with cataloguing games in case users bump into them, in gaming conventions, etc., and to keep this information easy to access, so you don't buy the same game twice (or for any other reason).

A Search function is also present and uses RAWG API to have a selection of games available for the user to find information about. This would, eventually, need to be coded without limiting user input.


Also, here is a video which touches in the objectives of the assignment, how most of them were achieved and how some problems were overcome.
